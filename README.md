## ProtectionPvP
A Bukkit/Spigot Plugin

With ProtectionPvP you can give players a period of time of protection against PvP, also offering the possibility of automatically giving this protection only once to new players.
You can also define areas for pvp in which you can decide if players with protection will be able to enter.
